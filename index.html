        <h2>We are the EE Student Advisory Board.</h2>
        <p >
            The Student Advisory Board is a committee created 
            to fairly represent the Electrical Engineering student body and 
            promote an enriching learning environment by providing the students 
            with a means for voicing their opinions and suggestions regarding 
            the department, faculty, and overall student experience.

          <h4>Why do we exist?</h4>
          <p>The Student Advisory Board exists as the liason between the student body and faculty. 
          Our duty is to ensure that the student body's needs are being met
          and that the appropriate action is being taken if not.

          <h4>Who are we?</h4>
          <p>The SAB consists of members from both the undergraduate and
          graduate student body. These members are appointed yearly.
          </p>

          <h4>What can I do to contribute?</h4>
          <p>If you have any concerns that need to be addressed about the 
          department, or about the cirriculum, please feel free to let us know.
          Any suggestions would also be welcome. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="span6">
          <h4>Our Prerogative</h4>
          <p>Any government entities need some forms of checks and balances. As
          students, we are still responsbile to make sure that the quality of 
          our curriculum and facilities are up to par. 
          </p>

          <p>
          The SAB is part of that
          system in the Electrical Engineering Department
          at UH Manoa. Our sole purpose is to serve the Electrical Engineering 
          student body, and see that everything is done to help the study body succeed.
          </p>

          <h4>Past Achievements</h4>
          <p>Statics and Introduction to Thermodynamics is no longer required, and 
          students also have the option of creating their own track. Matlab is now 
          a part of the curriculum (EE213).
