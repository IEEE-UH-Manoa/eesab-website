<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p>The Student Advisory Board (SAB) was created in 2001 to fairly represent 
the   Electrical Engineering student body and promote an enriching learning environment   by 
providing the students with a means for voicing their opinions and suggestions   regarding the 
department, faculty, and overall student experience. ABET now   requires student 
feedback/involvement in the assessment of passing accreditation,   and this is one of the SAB's 
primary purposes. 

<!-- The board consists of volunteer   members from each year level (i.e. Freshmen, 
Sophomore, etc.) to better represent   the range of student interests. --> 

Each year the SAB convene to 
discuss and poll   current issues. A report is compiled and presented to an Industrial Avisory   
Board (IAB) composed of outside professionals, who in turn discuss these issues   with faculty. 
<em>These reports count in bringing tough and important issues   to the table.</em></p><p>An 
introduction presentation made to the IAB in 2002 can be found <a 
href="2002/SAB_2002-Intro.ppt">here</a>.</p><p>The 2001 SAB was extremely effective in invoking change 
within the Electrical   Engineering Curriculum. Below are some examples of the positive impact the 
SAB   has made on our Department.</p><p><strong>SAB Recommendations:</strong></p><ol>  
<li>CE270 (Statics) and ME311 (Introduction to Thermodynamics) should not be     required.<br>    
a. Almost all students do not use the technical knowledge from either course.<br>    
b. Skills obtained in the course are already achieved in other technical curriculum.</li>  
<li>The track system is too restrictive and not flexible.</li>  <li>Course pre-requisite structure 
based on mathematics and physics courses     need to be re-evaluated.</li>  
<li>Create a Matlab tutorial/course, as well as a Matlab manual.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Department of Electrical Engineering Response:</strong></p><ol>  
<li>The Non-EE course requirement may be satisfied by CE270, ME311, a CE, ME,     OE, or BE course 
that is at the 300 level or higher. It may also be satisfied     by a physical or biological 
science course that is at the 300 level or higher,     subject to approval by the undergraduate 
curriculum committee.<br>    a. Now students can take what is most interesting to them.</li>  
<li> There is a new option for creating your own track. A student along with     a faculty member 
may propose a new track. Upon approval from the undergraduate     curriculum committee, this new 
track will be available to all students who     wish to enroll. </li>  <li>A faculty committee 
has been formed to re-evaluate the mathematics requirements.</li>  <li>Matlab will now be taught as 
a part of EE213.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center">
