teachers need to be able to lecture more effectivelyremove ME or CE prerequisites for ee majors								cancel the track system				Good luck to the next generation!	Offer more courses in EP track, ie laser, devices.	keep CE270 to have an overall engineering experience					keep CE 270 for incoming freshman, make CE 271 mandatory also definite help with physics track	Better EquipmentGRADE EASY!		TA'S NEED TO SPEAK UNDERSTANDABLE ENGLISH.  NEED TO UNDERSTAND ENGLISH.  SOME INSTRUCTORS NEED TO EXPLAIN BETTER AND WRITE NEATER ON THE BOARD.	A LOT OF BAD TAS -> SPEAK ENGLISH? COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY?  SOME PROFESSOR'S ASSIGN UNRELATED WORKER, AND DO NOT RELATE LECTURE TO ASSIGNMENTS.			TAS SHOULD BE MORE ORGANIZED AND PREPARED.  TAS SHOULD DO A DEMO @ BEGINNING OF LAB. TAS SHOULD BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXPLAIN THE MATERIAL (SPEAKING ENGLISH EFFECTIVELY WOULD BE HELPFUL.)		THEY DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH.  MAYBE ENGLISH (VERBAL COMMUNICATION COURSE).  THEY ALL FULL (EASE OF REGISTRATION FOR CLASSES)				Courses are intense when taken concurrently			What is up with the tutoring for EE?  More available tutoring would be helpful	UH SHOULD DEMAND HIGHER ENGLISH SKILLS FOR BOTH STUDENTS & TEACHERS. -- THE SITUATION IS DEPLORABLE FOR SOME CLASSES. (ORAL & WRITTEN)  I KNOW SENIORS WHO CANNOT WRITE A COMPLETE SENTENCE.	Money for board members:)						Summer school for E.E. classes?		(ee160) Dr. Tsuchiya doesn't know what he's lecturing about most of the time, he lets us out early and sometimies ets all confused of what he's teaching and asks one of his students to teach everyone about it.  Otherwise, most of the other teachers are very knowwledgeable		The TA for 211 scammed me $12 for the 211L book.  But I could not argue because he spoke phrases and shout sentences that resulted in a nonconclusive discussion.  *made 3 attempts to clean up the situation; all failed	If you put 3 types of majors for engineering, why do you only put tracks for electrical?												Fix the AC in classroom		Overall profs should work on better communicationskills & lecture skills to give students a betterunderstanding.  Take teaching classes.	Proffesors should do a good job as Shiroma in lecturing		LAB T/As should receive verbal/technical communications training.  Labs should be better equipped with components & equipment.								The faculty should be rated by not only the students, but by industry experts.  For example, industry experts should come in on random days, sit in a lecture, and rate the professors.  It would help if the professors actually paid any attention to feedbacks instead of just ignoring it.						KOIDE SHOULD RETIRE		Should work more with students.  Advising should be more personal.			SAB IS COOL  TAOKAHAS A BIG BELLY HE'S GONNA EAT US										The prerequistes are rigid sometimes.  Practically impossible to grad in 4, gotta start on track for to grad in 4 people who decide to go into EE take longerTA's need to be English proficient!			TA's need to teach class.  Two times out of two I've had TA's that when the lab print out says "Ta will explain" it never happened.  Our teams had to ask or guess and figure it out.
