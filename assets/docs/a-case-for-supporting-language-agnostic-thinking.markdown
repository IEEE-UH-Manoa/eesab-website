A Case for Supporting Language Agnostic Thinking and Engineering Design
=======================================================================

## Context

A rough outline/document written for the Electrical Engineering department
at UH Manoa highlighting possible support for language agnostic thinking
and engineering design to be integrated into the curriculum.

## Description
Straight from Wikipedia:

    "Language agnostic" describes a software development paradigm where a 
    particular language is chosen because of its appropriateness for a particular 
    task (taking into consideration all factors, including ecosystem, developer 
    skill-sets, performance, etc), and not purely because of the skill-set 
    available within a development team.

Summarizing: each programming language is a slightly different tool; if students can 
learn to take advantage of this to better apply the EE/CompE concepts they 
learned, there would be massive benefits

*My take:* Students when exposed to this concept can learn to wield different 
languages to solve engineering problems.  

## Motivation

* The industry today is software oriented 
* Software should support engineering efforts
* As such, supporting a language agnostic engineering curriculum can be extremely 
    powerful for our students

* Software is huge part of modern industry
* We have exposure to the traditional engineering languages:
    - C, C++, MATLAB
* _But we don't have much else to supplement this in the current curriculum_ 



_Benefits:_

1. Students are competitive with current industry
2. Students can be exposed to a wide range of tools, able to make connections between those tools
3. Able to take advantage of the most recent up-to date tools to create
    NEW content from those things (standing on the shoulders of giants)
4. Let the students take care of the learning themselves
5. Another way to practice problem solving; an engineering problem

## Credentials
* Name: Kenny Luong
* Computer Engineering, switched from computer science
* Senior (5th Year)
* Love software! Writing software to solve problems, create systems
* Experience: 
    - Co-Op at Advanced Micro Devices for two terms, Fall and Summer
    - Software Lead at Smart Campus Energy Lab under REIS (Dr. Anthony Kuh PI)
    - Currently the Chair of IEEE student branch
    - Mentorship at Imua Designs (Manoa Innovation Center)
* Case Study: My AMD Co-Op
    - Languages before
        - C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, Bash
    - Languages Applied There:
        - Ruby, Python, PHP, Bash, Javascript, Csh, Verilog

## A Current Example
* EE 491J: Computational Electromagnetics, taught by Dr. Iskander
    - Doesn’t matter what students write their programs in
    - Usage: C, Python, Ruby, R, MATLAB
    - Student case: Leveraged python to easily create a GUI that could interactively visualize some computations


## Concerns
* Yes, some work would have to be done in the cirriculumn
    - Understand there are financial limitations
    - But not asking to add language specific classes 
    - Maybe work this into some engineering classes somehow
* Implementation may be difficult; not sure how this would work out
* Need more research to be done on this


## Concluding
* Nothing is wrong with learning our current languages; gave me a great foundation
* The power comes from students knowing they are able to do this (in a reasonable way)
* Benefits
    - Helps students to become more independent and employable
    - Builds new engineering design thinking – leveraging existing toolsets 
    - Possible exposure to the latest trends, toolsets and languages; builds connections  
* Final Recommendation: the EE department at UH Manoa should have some 
stated goals about integrating language agnostic learning in the 
curriculm
