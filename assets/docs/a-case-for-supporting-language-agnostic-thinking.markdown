A Case for Supporting Language Agnostic Thinking and Engineering Design
=======================================================================

Description:
    "Language agnostic" describes a software development paradigm where a 
    particular language is chosen because of its appropriateness for a particular 
    task (taking into consideration all factors, including ecosystem, developer 
    skill-sets, performance, etc), and not purely because of the skill-set 
    available within a development team.

Summary Statement:
    * Each programming language is a slightly different tool; if students can 
         learn to take advantage of this to better apply the EE/CompE concepts they 
         learned, there would be massive benefits

Benefits:
    1. Students are competitive with current industry
    2. Students are exposed to a wide range of tools, able to 
        make connections between those tools
    3. Able to take advantage of the most recent up-to date tools to create
        NEW content from those things (standing on the shoulders of giants)
    4. Let the students take care of the learning themselves

Concerns:
    * Some Current Examples of Language Agnostic Classes:
        1. EE 491J
        2. Computational Electromagnetics, taught by Dr. Iskander
        3. EE 6something
        3. Algorithms
    * Yes, some work would have to be done in the cirriculumn
        - But not as much work as completely adding a new course
        - Students would drive this themselves
        - The concepts should be the same, the implementation can be different
    * Implementation may be difficult; not sure how this would work out

Credentials
    * Name: Kenny Luong
    * Computer Engineering, switched from computer science
    * Senior (5th Year)
    * Love software! Writing software to solve problems, create systems
    * Experience: 
        - Co-Op at Advanced Micro Devices for two terms, Fall and Summer
        - Software Lead at Smart Campus Energy Lab under REIS (Dr. Anthony Kuh PI)
        - Currently the Chair of IEEE student branch
        - Mentorship at Imua Designs (Manoa Innovation Center)

Motivation
    * The industry today is software oriented 
    * Software should support engineering efforts
    * As such, supporting a language agnostic engineering curriculum can be extremely 
        powerful for our students

Case
    * My AMD Co-Op
        - Languages before
            - C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, Bash
        - Languages Applied There:
            - Ruby, Python, PHP, Bash, Javascript, Csh, Verilog
