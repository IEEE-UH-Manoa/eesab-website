Technical How-To
==================

This site uses **Jekyll** - a static site generator that has some content management features.
Start with this installation guide: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

Note: if you're running on windows, this process is a little harder to get through.
I recommend using a virtual machine if you're running windows.

# Deploying the website

The eesab uses [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting,
so all you need to deploy the website is to merge your changes into
the `gh-pages` branch and then push it up to the repository on
github.

See the [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) site for more
information.
