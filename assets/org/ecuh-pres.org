* What is the SAB?

- An independent and fully student run committee 
- Represents the electrical engineering student body
- Supported by IEEE Student Branch at UH Manoa

** How we got started

- Created in 2001 under Dr. Anthony Kuh (EE Department Chair at the time) 
- To get student feedback required for ABET accreditation
- Made an initial presentation to Industry Advisory Board (IAB)
- Many of the first SAB recommendations were implemented and carry on to this day

** Our commitment to student body

- We represent the needs and concerns of the EE student body
- We provide a safe venue for students to bring up concerns and comments
- We strive to make sure that EE students are receiving the most up to date education

* Great things we've done

** Introduction of Custom EE Tracks

- EE students are now allowed to create and propose custom cirriculumn tracks. 
- A student along with a faculty member may propose a new track.
- A response to the EE SAB comment: "The track system is too restrictive and not flexible."

** Engineering Breadth Expanded

- Initially brought up in 2001 by the first SAB committee
- CE270 and ME311 are longer required for EE students. 
- Engineering Breadth can be satisfied by CE270, ME311, a CE, ME, OE, or BE course that is at the 300 level or higher.

** Payout of surplus fee monies

- What did SAB do last year to make this better?

** EE Student Project Lab (Holmes Hall 450)

- Proposed, planned and worked on by the 2013-2014 EE SAB
- Realized this year by 2014-2015 EE SAB 
- EE students now have access to a dedicated student project lab
