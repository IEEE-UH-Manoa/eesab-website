* What is the SAB?

- A student run committee created to represent the electrical engineering student body


** How we got started

- Created in 2001 under Dr. Anthony Kuh (EE Department Chair at the time) 
- To get student feedback required by ABET
- Made an initial presentation to the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB)
- Many of the first SAB recommendations were implemented and carry on to this day
