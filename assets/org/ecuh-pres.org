* What is the SAB?

- An independent and fully student run committee 
- Represents the electrical engineering student body
- Supported by IEEE Student Branch at UH Manoa

** How we got started

- Created in 2001 under Dr. Anthony Kuh (EE Department Chair at the time) 


Initial duties:

- Provide student feedback required for ABET accreditation
- Present findings to Industry Advisory Board (IAB)

** Commitment to student body

- We represent the needs and concerns of the EE student body
- We provide a safe venue for students to raise concerns and comments
- We strive to make sure that EE students are receiving the most current education

* Accomplishments

** Introduction of Custom EE Tracks

- Electrical Enginering students are now allowed to create and propose custom curriculum tracks
- Allows students to stay on top of latest shifts in industry and technology
- Increases interdisciplinary connections

** Engineering Breadth Expanded
# A response to the EE SAB comment: “The track system is too restrictive and not flexible.”

- Initially raised in 2001 by the first SAB committee
- Limited choices (CE270/ME311) expanded to all 300+ CEE/ME/OE/BE classes
- 300+ phys/bio science courses also available for proposal

** Payout of surplus fee monies

- Worked in alliance with faculty to make use of surplus student fees (2012-2013)
- Invested in IEEE student room, improvements to EE student services in Holmes Hall
- Ordered industrial equipment otherwise unavailable to students

** EE Student Project Lab (Holmes Hall 450)

- Proposed by the 2013-2014 EE SAB
- Electrical engineering students have access to a dedicated student project lab (first time)
- Holmes Hall 450 now open for student signups

** Community Involvement

- Helps maintain our community
- Created by students, for students
- Reach out to faculty and administration

** Resume Building

- SAB volunteer work is tangible and substantive
- Shows employers initiative and involvement
- A real engineering related extra-curricular activity

* Current Goals

- Improve our current website for more transparency
- Promote EE SAB; let students know they have a venue for concerns
- Become fully self-sustaining to continue to support students
