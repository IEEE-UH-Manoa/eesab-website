* What is the SAB?

- An independent and fully student run committee 
- Represents the electrical engineering student body
- Supported by IEEE Student Branch at UH Manoa

** How we got started

- Created in 2001 under Dr. Anthony Kuh (EE Department Chair at the time) 
- To get student feedback required for ABET accreditation
- Made an initial presentation to Industry Advisory Board (IAB)

** Our commitment to student body

- We represent the needs and concerns of the EE student body
- We provide a safe venue for students to raise concerns and comments
- We strive to make sure that EE students are receiving the most current education

* Great things we've done

** Introduction of Custom EE Tracks

- Electrical Enginering students are now allowed to create and propose custom curriculum tracks
- Allows students to stay on top of latest shifts in industry and technology
- Increases interdisciplinary connections

** Engineering Breadth Expanded
# A response to the EE SAB comment: “The track system is too restrictive and not flexible.”

- Initially raised in 2001 by the first SAB committee
- Limited choices of CE270 and ME311 expanded to all 300+ CEE/ME/OE/BE
- 300+ phys/bio science courses also available for proposal

** Payout of surplus fee monies

- What did SAB do last year to make this better?

** EE Student Project Lab (Holmes Hall 450)

- Proposed by the 2013-2014 EE SAB
- For the first time, electrical engineering students have access to dedicated student project lab
- Holmes Hall 450 now open for student signups
