* What is the SAB?

- An independent and fully student run committee 
- Represents the electrical engineering student body
- Supported by IEEE Student Branch at UH Manoa

** How we got started

- Created in 2001 under Dr. Anthony Kuh (EE Department Chair at the time) 
- To get student feedback required by ABET
- Made an initial presentation to the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB)
- Many of the first SAB recommendations were implemented and carry on to this day

** Our commitment to student body

- We represent the needs and concerns of the EE student body
- We provide a safe venue for students to bring up concerns and comments
- We strive to make sure that EE students are receiving the most up to date education

* Great things we've done

** Introduction of Custom EE Tracks

- Electrical Enginering students are now allowed to create and propose custom cirriculumn tracks. 
- This gives students 

** CE270 and ME311 No Longer Required 

- Initially brought up in 2001 by the first SAB committee
- CE270 and ME311 are longer required for EE students. 

** Student Project Lab (Holmes Hall 450)

- Proposed by the 2013-2014 EE SAB
- For the first time, electrical engineering students will have access to a dedicated student project lab.
- Holmes Hall 450 is now open for student signups

* Things we offer future members

** Leadership

- Practice leadership skills
- Address a specific a student concern
- Help drive some new changes 

** Community Involvement

- Help to maintain our community
- Created by students, for students

** Resume Building

- Can define exactly what you contributed and how that affected students`
- Shows employers initiative and involvement
- An engineering related extra-cirricular activity

* Current Goals

- Improve our current website to be more transparent 
- Promote the EE SAB and let students know they have a venue for concerns
- Become a fully self-sustaining committee to continue to support students
