      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>
        The Student Advisory Board (SAB) was created in 2001 to fairly represent the 
        Electrical Engineering student body and promote an enriching learning environment 
        by providing the students with a means for voicing their opinions and suggestions 
        regarding the department, faculty, and overall student experience. ABET now requires 
        student feedback/involvement in the assessment of passing accreditation, and this is 
        one of the SAB's primary purposes. Each year the SAB convene to discuss and poll current 
        issues. A report is compiled and presented to an Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) composed 
        of outside professionals, who in turn discuss these issues with faculty. These reports 
        count in bringing tough and important issues to the table.

      The 2001 SAB was extremely effective in invoking change within the Electrical Engineering 
      Curriculum. Below are some examples of the positive impact the SAB has made on our Department.
