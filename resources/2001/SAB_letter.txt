Students and Faculty,

The Student Advisory Board (SAB) submitted a report to the Industrial Advisory
Board (IAB) on October 4, 2001.  The report reflects the concerns and opinions from a representative group of the electrical engineering student body.  For several of these concerns, recommendations have been made.  The report can be found at http://www-ee.eng.hawaii.edu/~sasaki/Abet/index.html.

The SAB would like to thank participating students for their support and input.  We hope that they will continue to play an active role in the improvement of
the educational quality of the EE program at UH.  Furthermore, we hope that
other students realize that their comments do matter, and we encourage them to
participate in the future.

The SAB would also like to thank the faculty for giving the students an
opportunity to express their concerns.  The SAB looks forward to working with
the entire EE Department to improve the EE undergraduate program.

Please send all comments, questions, or concerns to
eesab@spectra.eng.hawaii.edu

Thanks.

Student Advisory Board
