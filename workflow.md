EE Student Advisory Board Workflow
=====================================

The Electrical Engineering Student Advisory Board uses a github-based workflow 
for document editing. This workflow is highly parallel and allows easier collaboration
across a single document.


# General Workflow
1. Create a branch with the document or project you're trying to create.
    1. Use the appropriate branch as a source
    2. Give it a descriptive name (professional_fees, stipend_issue, etc.) 
2. Make changes on that branch
    1. Edit all you want. Make commits often and when you want other students to provide feedback 
    2. Collaborate and finalize the document
3. Once you're sure the project/document is completely done, submit a pull request and tag the webmaster
    1. Click "pull request" on the right hand side and choose the feature branch.
    2. Since we're working on the website repository, only production-grade material should be merged to the master

# Minutes

1. Secretary records the minutes in the form that he is familiar with
2. Webmaster (or the secretary) creates a branch for the minutes and creates a file for the minutes
3. President signs off on the bottom of the minutes, approving them.
4. At least 3 other officers sign off on the minutes as well.
5. Webmaster submits a pull request.
6. Webmaster submits the pull request and merges the branch into master.
7. Webmaster deploys the website to the gh-pages branch and makes sure the site is live and bug free.
