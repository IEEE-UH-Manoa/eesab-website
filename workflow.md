EE Student Advisory Board Workflow
=====================================

The Electrical Engineering Student Advisory Board uses a github-based workflow 
for document editing. This workflow is highly parallel and allows easier collaboration
across a single document.

1. Create a branch with the document or project you're trying to create.
    1. Use the appropriate branch as a source
    2. Give it a descriptive name (professional_fees, stipend_issue, etc.) 
2. Make changes on that branch
    1. Edit all you want. Make commits often and when you want other students to provide feedback 
    2. Collaborate and finalize the document
3. Once you're sure the project/document is completely done, submit a pull request and tag the webmaster
    1. Click "pull request" on the right hand side and choose the feature branch.
    2. Since we're working on the website repository, only production-grade material should be merged to the master
