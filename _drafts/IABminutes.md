1. Proposal for integration of language agnostic learning concepts for students 
    1. Definition:  "Language agnostic" describes a software development paradigm 
    where a particular language is chosen because of its 
    appropriateness for a particular task…” –Wikipedia
    2. My take: Students when exposed to this concept can learn to 
    wield different languages to solve engineering problems. 
    3. The current curriculum does not support this, and **should be
    integrated into the curriculum in some form or another**
    4. Benefits:
        1. Students are competitive with current industry
        2. Students are exposed to a wide range of tools, able to
            make connections between those tools
        3. Able to take advantage of the most recent up-to date tools to create
            NEW content from those things (standing on the shoulders of giants)
        4. Let the students take care of the learning themselves
    5. More information can be found [here:] (../assets/docs/a-case-for-supporting-language-agnostic-thinking.markdown)

2. Example would be to ask professors to mention it in the class
3.	Dr. Iskander in EE471 Electromagnetic Computation Course is a perfect example. Dr. Iskander doesn’t mind the students using other languages to get the simulation done.
4.	Benefits of getting an officer position to get a job
  1.	Roles of an officer position
  2.	Say how you are doing and how great
5.	Resume of students
6.	Get students to use GitHub and LinkedIn
  1.	Companies use this as recruiting tools
7.	Spectrum Analyzer for EE343
8.	Create and Maintain Transparency with IAB, SAB, EE Dept
  1.	Keep comments confidential
