Peter Crouch, the dean of the UH College of Engineering, delivered a reply to
our [previous letter]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts/stipendreply) last week. You can
view the [original PDF](oncefelixuploadsit) as scanned. Here's a quick summary.

## Letter summary

### Main view ###

### 'Compensation' v. 'award' ###

### Use of stipend funding ###

## Our advice ##

Regardless of whether or not you agree with the Dean's interpretation (and by
extension, the College's), the conclusion is the same: once you take on work on
a stipend basis, the financial adjustment mechanisms will automatically subtract
that amount from their disbursement calculations.

If you are unsure of your remaining financial aid allocations or burden, or if
you know that a stipend will push you over the limit set for you, refuse to
accept stipends for your work, and ask to be paid as a student hire.
