### Fiscal Situation described by Dr. Shiroma 
**Location: Holmes 389**
####Sources of Revenue 
* General Funds Legislature Appropriation
	- Revenue change to University of Hawai'i Manoa began in 1996
	- Trend has been getting worse 
* Special Tuition funds (S-Funds)
	- Increasing but at a slight rate
* Extramural Research Funds
	- 9-Month Salary
	- Professors could earn more though research grant
	- Covers grad students and Research assistants
* Small Sources
	- Donations from alumni. E.g. Dr. Leibert's Office
#### Expense increases
* More buildings have been added over the years increasing cost of utilities 
  - Salaries have received roughly 3% cut across the board
  - Professional Fees have potential of being taken away by administration if not spent
* Sources of funds FY09 vs FY13. This knowledge is public
  - FY 2009 Total: $760.3 million
  - FY 2013 841.1 million
  - Decrease of roughly $61 million in general funds
  - Notable differences
	- taxpayer 35% vs 25% (what is this refering to?)

#### Amount of general funds has been going down, but the amount of tuition has gone up
* The decline in G-funds is a lot steeper than the tuition curve
* Resulting  in a deficit Enrollment increases this year but the General fund is not increasing
* Tuition is not being distributed properly to Manoa
  - CE and ME had big increase in enrollment but no increase in funds
* Hiring Freeze 
  - Limits on hiring new TAs, lecturers, Graders, etc.
  - Approvals have to be made in order to make exceptions  
* Idea of a tuition increase is of the table for now
  - Good for students
  - Administration now scrabbling for funds
* If the enrollment goes down so does the tuition fund but if the enrollment goes up the tuition fund does not
  - There is no noticeable correlation to tuition allocation with CoE enrollment.
* UHM mandate for units to hold a reserve have helped in some instances
  - One department had a surplus and that surplus ended up helping another with their deficit
* Governor’s restrictions will reduce future spending towards UH
* "Professions Fees for College of Nursing is $1000 and College of Engineering is $500 but isn’t engineering worth more to the community?"
  - There is  focus in fixing tuition prices before anything happens to the Professions Fees 
* The reason people should come to UH Manoa is because a student will get more for their money
#### Questions brought up by attendees
* "What is the difference between the General funds and Tuition?"
* "Money was lost between gross tuition and net tuition, where did that money go?"
* "Who is in control of the University?"
* "Why should people come to University of Hawai’i at Manoa?"

#### Announcement of a Speaker in POST 723 on next week Wednesday at 1:00 PM. (Anyone remember the name of the speaker?)
