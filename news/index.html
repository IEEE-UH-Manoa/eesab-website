        The 2001 SAB was extremely effective in invoking change within the 
        Electrical Engineering Curriculum. Below are some examples of the 
        positive impact the SAB has made on our Department.
        </p>
        <h5> SAB Recommendations </h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
            CE270 (Statics) and ME311 (Introduction to Thermodynamics) 
            should not be required.
            <ul>
                <li>
                Almost all students do not use the technical knowledge 
                from either course.
                </li>
                <li>
                Skills obtained in the course are already achieved in 
                other technical curriculum.
                </li>
            </ul
            </li>

            <li>
                The track system is too restrictive and not flexible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Course pre-requisite structure based on mathematics and 
                physics courses need to be re-evaluated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a Matlab tutorial/course, as well as a Matlab manual.
            </li>
        </ol>
    
        <h5>Department of Electrical Engineering Response </h5>
        <ol>
        <li>
            The Non-EE course requirement may be satisfied by CE270, ME311, 
            a CE, ME, OE, or BE course that is at the 300 level or higher. 
            It may also be satisfied by a physical or biological science 
            course that is at the 300 level or higher, subject to approval 
            by the undergraduate curriculum committee.
            <ul>
            <li>
                Now students can take what is most interesting to them.
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            There is a new option for creating your own track. A student 
            along with a faculty member may propose a new track. 
            Upon approval from the undergraduate curriculum committee, 
            this new track will be available to all students who wish to 
            enroll.
        </li>
        <li>
        A faculty committee has been formed to re-evaluate the 
        mathematics requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
        Matlab will now be taught as a part of EE213.
        </li>

        </ol>
